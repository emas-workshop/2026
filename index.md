## EMAS 2026
**May 25–26, 2026**  
Co-located with [AAMAS 2026](https://cyprusconferences.org/aamas2026/)  
Paphos, Cyprus

---

## Scope
EMAS 2026 builds on the long-standing tradition of the Workshop on Engineering Multi-Agent Systems, advancing the design, implementation, and deployment of autonomous agents and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) through research on theories, architectures, languages, platforms, and methodologies. To build on decades of established MAS engineering approaches and engage with emerging augmented language models and agentic systems, this 14th edition focuses on [Hybrid Agent Architectures and Multi-Agent Systems](cfp/). We invite contributions covering the diversity of approaches to engineering agents and MAS: submissions may focus on established or emerging approaches, as well as hybrid approaches that integrate the two, exploring, among others, [questions](cfp/#topics) such as how different agent architectures can be combined to create more capable agents, and how MAS can be designed to ensure interoperability, coordination, and governance among heterogeneous agents.
